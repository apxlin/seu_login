# seu_login
 simple seu web login script
 
 一个是东南大学网络登录脚本，一个是挂机脚本
 
 之前晚上网络容易掉线，所以我特意写了这样一个脚本，方便整夜挂机，不过现在好像已经用不上了。
 
 另外一个是正常的登录脚本，可以不用打开浏览器登录校园账号，直接运行脚本即可完成登录
 
 具体使用方法看说明


One is the network login script of Southeast University, the other is the on-hook script

The network was easily disconnected in the evening before, so I specially wrote such a script to hang up all night, but now it seems that it is no longer necessary.

The other is a normal login script. You can log in to your campus account without opening a browser. You can run the script to complete the login.

See instructions for specific usage
